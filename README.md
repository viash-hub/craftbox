A collection of custom-tailored scripts and applied utilities built with
Viash.

## Introduction

`craftbox` offers a unique set of specialized scripts and tools,
meticulously crafted and packaged using the Viash (https://viash.io)
framework. These components are designed for specific, often custom, use
cases where tailored solutions are paramount.

Emphasizing the Viash principles, `craftbox` components aim for
**reusability**, **reproducibility**, and adherence to **best
practices**. Key features generally include:

- **Standalone & Nextflow Ready:** Components are built to run directly
  via the command line or be smoothly integrated into Nextflow
  workflows.
- **Custom Implementations:** Contains scripts and tools developed for
  particular tasks that may not be found in broader collections.
- **High Quality Standards (promoted by Viash):**
  - Clear documentation for components and their parameters.
  - Full exposure of underlying script/tool arguments for fine-grained
    control.
  - Containerized (Docker) to ensure dependency management and a
    consistent, reproducible runtime environment.
  - Unit tested where applicable to ensure components function as
    expected.

## Example Usage

Viash components in craftbox can be run in various ways:

``` mermaid lang="mermaid"
flowchart TD
    A[craftbox v0.2.0] --> B(Viash Hub Launch)
    A --> C(Viash CLI)
    A --> D(Nextflow CLI)
    A --> E(Seqera Cloud)
    A --> F(As a dependency)
```

### 1. Via the Viash Hub Launch interface

You can run this component directly from the Viash Hub [Launch
interface](https://www.viash-hub.com/launch?package=craftbox&version=v0.2.0&component=concat_rtext&runner=Executable).

### 2. Via the Viash CLI

You can run this component directly from the command line using the
Viash CLI.

``` bash
viash run vsh://craftbox@v0.2.0/concat_rtext -- --help

viash run vsh://craftbox@v0.2.0/concat_rtext -- \
  --input path/to/input.txt \
  --input path/to/compressed.txt.gz \
  --output path/to/output.txt
```

This will run the component with the specified input files and output
the results to the specified output file.

### 3. Via the Nextflow CLI or Seqera Cloud

You can run this component as a Nextflow pipeline.

``` bash
nextflow run https://packages.viash-hub.com/vsh/craftbox \
  -revision v0.2.0 \
  -main-script target/nextflow/concat_rtext/main.nf \
  -latest -resume \
  -profile docker \
  --input "path/to/input.txt;path/to/compressed.txt.gz" \
  --output path/to/output.txt
```

**Note:** Make sure that the [Nextflow
SCM](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/git.html#git-configuration) is
set up properly. You can do this by adding the following lines to your
`~/.nextflow/scm` file:

``` groovy
providers.vsh.platform = 'gitlab'
providers.vsh.server = 'https://packages.viash-hub.com'
```

**Tip:** This will also work with Seqera Cloud or other
Nextflow-compatible platforms.

### 4. As a dependency

In your Viash config file (`config.vsh.yaml`), you can add this
component as a dependency:

``` yaml
dependencies:
  - name: concat_rtext
    repository: vsh://craftbox@v0.2.0
```

**Tip:** See the [Viash
documentation](https://viash.io/guide/nextflow_vdsl3/create-a-pipeline.html#pipeline-as-a-component)
for more details on how to use Viash components as a dependency in your
own Nextflow workflows.
