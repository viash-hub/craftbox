name: craftbox
summary: |
  A collection of custom-tailored scripts and applied utilities built with Viash.
description: |
  `craftbox` offers a unique set of specialized scripts and tools, meticulously crafted and packaged using the Viash (https://viash.io) framework.
  These components are designed for specific, often custom, use cases where tailored solutions are paramount.

  Emphasizing the Viash principles, `craftbox` components aim for **reusability**, **reproducibility**, and adherence to **best practices**. Key features generally include:

  * **Standalone & Nextflow Ready:** Components are built to run directly via the command line or be smoothly integrated into Nextflow workflows.
  * **Custom Implementations:** Contains scripts and tools developed for particular tasks that may not be found in broader collections.
  * **High Quality Standards (promoted by Viash):**
      * Clear documentation for components and their parameters.
      * Full exposure of underlying script/tool arguments for fine-grained control.
      * Containerized (Docker) to ensure dependency management and a consistent, reproducible runtime environment.
      * Unit tested where applicable to ensure components function as expected.
